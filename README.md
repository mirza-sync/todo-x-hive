# Todo X Hive

> Haven't done a Flutter project for a while. It's time to brush up my rusty Flutter skill ðŸ˜†.

This is a To-do app that uses Hive for storage.

Reference: [TO DO App â€¢ Flutter Tutorial â™¥ Hive Local Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgr47QBZWA).
> p/s: This tutorial shows very very simple way of using Hive. Literally just store data in specific key, and you can update/delete the data based on its key. There's no schema definition involved.
